## RÃ´mulo Massaroth de Farias

I'm a young developer with big goals. Studying information system's bachelor at Brazil, I'm looking for personal development and real commitments with real companies. After some experience at the professional world my next badge will be dive into the academic life and teach new developers the best skills of real world!

Now a days my main language is PHP, but I really often use another languages in personal, professional and academic projects (Python, C# .NET and Java) . Together my development skills I study OOP concepts and patterns, thinking a lot about software architecture.

Well, I have a long road to travel and learn every time more is the best way to reach my goals :)
